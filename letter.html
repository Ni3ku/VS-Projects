    <h2><b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b></h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen, <br><br>

        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as
        part<br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        <br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li> Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p> You can find more information about <a
            href="https://bowvalleycollege.ca/student-resources/academic-services/important-dates">important university
            dates</a> on our website.</p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
        just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
        intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
            audience
            size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        research</p>
    <p> to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2 class="bold">Exotic dance moves</h2>

    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
    question,<br>
    my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>

    Polynesian chicken dance
    <div>
        <p class="indent">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would
            dance around in a</p>
        <p class="indent"> circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
    </div>
    Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
    <div>
        <p class="indent"> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this
            dance, which involved</p>
        <p class="indent"> huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            imperceptibly tiny, very</p>
        <p class="indent"> rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
            modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
    </div>
    Arctic robot dance<br>
    <div>
        <p class="indent"> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to
            have discovered a new</p>
        <p class="indent"> dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of
            Northern Alaska and</p>
        <p class="indent"> Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they
            were really cold.</p>
    </div>

    Yours sincerely,<br>
